== Default settings

BCG has a lot of configuration settings. Most of them has default settings, but they can be overwritten by the individual configuration file.

Below all default settings are listed.

// include is disabled on github
// application.yml 2025-07
----
bcs:
  product: BirthdayCalendarService
  calendar-category: Birthday
  run-on-start: false
  cron: "0 30 4 * * *"

event:
  summary: "🎂 ~first-name~ ~last-name~"
  description: "Birthday: ~birthday~"
  date-format: yyyy-MM-dd
  alarm: 1d

dav:
  max-retries: 5
  retry-delay-in-seconds: 1
----

Application settings:

- `bcs.product`: Name of the product used in the created calendar files, known as 'prodId'.
- `bcs.calendar-category`: The value depends on the categories of the caldav server and its localization. +
*as this value is used to delete and create birthdays, the value must be set correctly initially and must not be changed!*
- `bcs.run-on-start`: The creation of the birthday calendar will be triggered directly at the start of the service.

Event settings:

- `event.summary`: The title of the birthday event.
- `event.description`: The description of the birthday event.
- `event.date-format`: The format of the birthday date.
- `event.alarm`: Triggers a notification **before** the birthday event. Expected format: <number>[dh] +
d=day, h=hours +
E.g.: _12h_ triggers a notification 12 hours before the birthday event.

The placeholders '&#126;first-name&#126;', '&#126;last-name&#126;' and '&#126;birthday&#126;' are self-explain placeholder that can be used in 'description' and 'summary'.

Dav settings:

- `dav.delay-in-seconds`: This property determines the delay interval (in seconds) between retries in the case of network problems.
- `dav.retry-delay-in-seconds`: The maximum number of retries due to network errors.

  card-url: https://dav.my-domain.org/SOGo/dav/dav-user/Contacts/personal/
----

- `dav.user`, `dav.password`: Authentication credentials for the dav server.
- `dav.card-url`: The address book URL from which birthdays are read.
- `dav.cal-url`: The url of the birthday calendar which must be created. _To be on the safe side, it's a good idea to use an extra birthday calendar! But it is not mandatory since https://github.com/th-schwarz/BirthdayCalendarCreator/issues/2[A remote event should only be deleted if its categories contain the defined birthday category.]_
