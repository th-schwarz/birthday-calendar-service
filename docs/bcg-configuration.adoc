----

- `bcg.product`: Name of the product used in the created calendar files, known as 'prodId'.
- `bcg.calendar-category`: The value depends on the categories of the caldav server and its localization. +
*as this value is used to delete and create birthdays, the value must be set correctly initially and must not be changed!*
- `bcg.run-on-start`: The creation of the birthday calendar will be triggered directly at the start of the service.

Event settings:

- `event.summary`: The title of the birthday event.
- `event.description`: The description of the birthday event.
- `event.date-format`: The format of the birthday date.
- `event.alarm`: Triggers a notification **before** the birthday event. Expected format: <number>[dh] +
d=day, h=hours +
E.g.: _12h_ triggers a notification 12 hours before the birthday event.

The placeholders '&#126;first-name&#126;', '&#126;last-name&#126;' and '&#126;birthday&#126;' are self-explain placeholder hat can be used in 'description' and 'summary'.

----

- `dav.user`, `dav.password`: Authentication credentials for the dav server.
- `dav.card-url`: The address book URL from which birthdays are read.
- `dav.cal-url`: The url of the birthday calendar which must be created. _To be on the safe side, it's a good idea to use an extra birthday calendar! But it is not mandatory since https://github.com/th-schwarz/BirthdayCalendarCreator/issues/2[A remote event should only be deleted if its categories contain the defined birthday category.]_
